\maketitle

\section{Introduction}
Social media adoption among the aging group of people aged 45+ poses a different kind of challenge since this age group perceives things differently concerning platforms as compared to younger generations. Most stereotypes revolve around privacy issues, a lack of familiarity with technology, and the existence of misinformation. This paper aims to validate and explore these stereotypes through qualitative and quantitative research approaches in order to provide recommendations on designing more accessible social media platforms.

\section{Research Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Understand the general stereotype held by Old age people about social media.
    \item Validate whether these stereotypes align with actual experiences.
    \item Explore factors such as technology familiarity, privacy concerns, and misinformation that influence these perceptions.
    \item Give suggestions for improvement to social media services for Old Age People.
    \item Understand how Social Media is important in connecting Older generation with Younger generation.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Stereotype Analysis}
\subsection{Social Media as a Cultural Destroyer}
Many older adults fear that social media will negatively impact traditional cultural values and practices. They often believe that these platforms encourage behaviors that undermine community harmony and regional traditions, leading to reluctance in adopting them. This perception is frequently accompanied by concerns over cultural dilution and generational conflict, causing older adults to view social media with suspicion \cite{Campbell2018, Lindley2016}.

\subsection{Technological Unfamiliarity}
It's common to see older adults as less familiar with technology, which can create hesitation in adopting digital tools. This stereotype is supported by studies showing that navigation and interface complexities often present significant barriers for this demographic \cite{Neves2019}.

\subsection{Social Media for Religious Matters Only}
In some rural contexts, older adults may primarily associate social media with religious content or community announcements. They often use these platforms mainly to share religious messages or participate in virtual prayer groups, viewing broader social interactions as less relevant. This limited use highlights a preference for engaging with faith-based content over exploring the wider functionalities of social media \cite{Campbell2021, Yadlapalli2020}.

\subsection{Privacy Concerns}
Many older adults express heightened concerns about privacy compared to younger users. Research indicates that these privacy worries can deter them from fully engaging with social media due to mistrust of data collection and usage \cite{Hargittai2017}.

\subsection{Fear of Misinformation}
There's a perception that older adults are more vulnerable to misinformation, which contributes to their distrust of social media platforms. Studies have shown that individuals aged 65 and older often share a higher volume of fake news articles than younger age groups, reinforcing this stereotype \cite{Guess2019}.

\subsection{Social Media as Superficial}
Older adults may view social media as trivial or lacking meaningful engagement, which can lead to disengagement. Research has indicated that they tend to use social media primarily to stay in touch with family, in contrast to younger generations who often use it for entertainment and social networking \cite{Anderson2020}.



\section{Research Methods}

To validate these stereotypes, I used the following methods:

\subsection{Interviews}
\textbf{Why Use This Method}: Interviews allow in-depth exploration of personal experiences and can uncover nuanced concerns about social media.


\textbf{Sample Interview Questions}:
\begin{enumerate} 
\item How comfortable are you using social media platforms like Facebook or WhatsApp?
\item How do you evaluate the trustworthiness of information you find on social media?
\item How do you feel social media impacts traditional cultural values in your community? 
\item Have you ever felt hesitant to use social media due to concerns about your technological skills? 
\item In what ways do you primarily use social media? Is it mostly for religious purposes, or do you engage in other activities? 
\item Can you describe any experiences you've had with misinformation on social media? How did it affect your perception of the platform? 
\item What features do you think would make social media easier for you to navigate? 
\item Do you feel that your privacy is adequately protected on social media platforms? Why or why not? \item How do you choose which social media platforms to use? What factors influence your decisions? 
\item Have you ever experienced generational conflict related to social media use within your family or community? Can you share an example? 
\item How important is it for you to connect with family and friends through social media compared to traditional methods of communication? 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Focus Groups}
\textbf{Why Use This Method}: Focus groups allow old age people to discuss their social media experiences in a group setting, facilitating peer validation of common stereotypes.

\textbf{Sample Focus Group Questions}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What are your thoughts on the safety of sharing personal information on social media?
    \item What features or functions make social media challenging or easy for you to use?
    \item How do you feel about the accuracy of news and information shared on these platforms?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Observation}
\textbf{Why Use This Method}: Observation allows direct insight into how old age people use social media, highlighting any usability challenges.

\textbf{Observed Behavior}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Difficulty navigating between pages or understanding notifications.
    \item Hesitancy to engage in activities that require sharing personal information (e.g., commenting or posting).
    \item Blinding believing false information and sharing it to the relatives.
    \item Finding difficulty in reading the content due to letters size and can't explore the settings.
    \item Watching the content in the social media by youth making them uncomfortable feeling against their customs and culture.
\end{itemize}

\section{Recommendations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Social media platforms should prioritize user-friendly design features, including larger text and more intuitive navigation paths for old age users.
    \item Platforms should provide clear and accessible privacy settings, alongside tutorials to help old age people manage their privacy concerns.
    \item Social Media should regularize their content and should prefer a mode for old age people
    \item Fact-checking tools and media literacy resources should be integrated into social media to help old age people identify credible information.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
The stereotypes that old age people hold about social media, including technological unfamiliarity, privacy concerns, and misinformation, are largely validated by research. To address these issues, platforms should consider user-centered design and education efforts that cater specifically to the needs and concerns of old age people.
